### Pairing
To get the device into pairing mode, press the up button 3 times briefly and then hold it for a long time (almost 20s). After about 10s the LED starts blinking slowly, continue to hold until it starts blinking rapidly. Now you can release it. Pairing will take a while to complete. The LED will blink and change color during this process.

### Control
The shutter control uses a simple timer to control the duration to open/close the shutter. Unfortunately the Zigbee command to set the timer is not known yet. Even if you set the timer via Bluetooth, it will be reset to the default 2 minutes every time you bring it back to Zigbee mode.
The consequence is, that if your shutter is faster than 2 minutes, the position information will not match with the shutter position (since the transition from 0% to 100% takes 120s).
Example: If your shutter motor needs 20 seconds to move from open to closed, it will already be closed at 1/6 of the time, i.e. at position 85. It will still take 120s for the position information to go from 100 down to 0.

If you use a shutter motor with positional switches, that stops at the Open or closed position, this will not be an issue. If you rely on the control to shut of the motor, the current implementation will keep the motor pulling until the timer has elapsed, that might not be a good idea.
If your shutter motor needs more than 2 minutes, I suppose it will stop before reaching the final position.

### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
\`\`\`
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
\`\`\`

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

\`\`\` yaml
- id: 'Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature'
  alias: Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature
  description: Automatically Publish the outdoor temperature to thermostats
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor
    platform: state
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      payload_template: '{{ states(''sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor'') | string }}'
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
    service: mqtt.publish
\`\`\`

### Enabling time
To enable _time_ you need to send a _blank_ message to the following MQTT topic:
\`\`\`
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_time
\`\`\`
Everytime the above message is sent, Zigbee2MQTT will calculate the current time and send it to the thermostat.

        note: `
### General
The ubisys C4 remote control unit seems to be primarily targeted to be directly bound to other ZigBee devices to control them. Therefore it does not emit plain "click" events or similar but can be configured to send ZigBee commands like on, off, toggle, cover up, cover down etc. from up to 6 endpoints (4 with on/off, level and scene clusters for lights and another 2 to control window covering devices).
When used with Zigbee2MQTT all endpoints get bound to the coordinator automatically. Therefore all actions will be sent to the coordinator and forwarded to MQTT in addition to being sent directly via ZigBee to other devices that have potentially been bound manually (see [Binding](../information/binding.html) for more information).
In it's factory reset configuration an ubisys C4 just sends a toggle command (originating from endpoints 1 to 4 respectively) for each input. Therefore basic keypresses on attached momentary switches can be processed through Zigbee2MQTT even without further input configuration.


### Configuring Inputs
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set\` the following device attributes can be set to configure inputs:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_device_setup": {
        "inputConfigurations": [0, 0, 0, 0],
        "inputActions": [
            [0, 13, 1, 6, 0, 2],
            [1, 13, 2, 6, 0, 2],
            [2, 13, 3, 6, 0, 2],
            [3, 13, 4, 6, 0, 2]
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`
For further details on these attributes please take a look at the
[ubisys C4 Technical Reference Manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-c4-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.8.5. Device Setup Cluster (Server)" and the "ZigBee Device Physical Input Configurations Integrator's Guide" (which can be obtained directly from ubisys upon request).
Please note that there seems to be a size limit on the amount of data that can successfullly be written to \`inputActions\`, so not all configurations theoretically possbile might work in reality.

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get/configure_device_setup\` the values of the configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log.

### Decoupling
You can decouple the switch input form the state, this allows you to control a group of lights using the switch without cutting the power to the bulbs.

By default the input is bound to itself, so we need to unbind it and then bind a zigbee group

\`\`\`
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <switch_friendly_name>
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/bind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <group_name>
\`\`\`

To restore the original behavior you unbind the group and rebind the device

\`\`\`
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <group_name>
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/bind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <switch_friendly_name>

### Pairing
Philips LivingColors IRIS and Philips LivingColors Bloom Devices that comes with
Philips (HUE) Remote Gen 2 (Touch Wheel) or Gen 3 (Round Click Wheel) can be paired via Zigbee.
Devices with Gen 1 Remote don't use Zigbee and can not be paired.
The Philips LivingColors Remote can not be paired via Zigbee because it only support ZigBee Light Link (ZLL).

To Pair hold Button ON and Bottom Left Key (Favorite 1) on the Remote in Front of the Device until
the Device Light blinks and lights Orange. If connection was successful the Device Light will light Green.

**WARNING**: If you pair your Device to a Zigbee Network which is not using a ZLL Channel
you can't reset the Device with the Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 3.
The Gen 3 Remote will only try ZLL Channels to find the Device! Maybe it's possible to reset
the Device with a Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 2 as it should try all Zigbee Channels to find the Device.

### Pairing
Factory resetting a Hue bulb can be accomplished in 5 ways.
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

#### Touchlink factory reset
See [Touchlink](../information/touchlink)

#### Hue bridge
When the bulb is still connected to the Hue bridge, you can simply factory reset the bulb
by removing it from the bridge via the Hue app.

#### Hue dimmer switch
[VIDEO: Factory reset a Hue bulb with Hue dimmer switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlEAELiJKs).

#### Bluetooth (if supported by device)
Install the Philips Hue Bluetooth app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.signify.hue.blue)
or iPhone. You can use the app to trigger a factory reset on a paired light. (Note: The light will only be in bluetooth pairing
mode for a couple of minutes after poweron)

#### TRADFRI remote control
This may also be possible with the
[Tradfri Remote Control](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/tradfri-remote-control__0489469_PE623665_S4.JPG)
by pressing and holding the reset button on the bottom of the remote (next to the battery).

#### Using the dimmer to reset a Hue light bulb

To use the Hue dimmer switch to factory reset a Hue light bulb see
[HOWTO: Factory reset a Hue bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlEAELiJKs).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.
This method also works for Philips Hue Lightstrips.
Hue dimmer switch can also be used to factory reset Ikea Trådfri light bulbs using the same method described above.

### Binding
If you want to bind the dimmer to a (Hue) lamp you'll have to *[bind it to the lamp through MQTT](../information/binding.html)* and unbind it from the coordinator. Use the dimmer as source and a literal \`coordinator\` as target for that.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* \`multiple_press_timeout\`: Controls how long (in seconds) subsequent key presses may be apart and still count as one event. The default is 250ms (0.25).

### Troubleshooting

#### Resetting the device

- Method 1: Press all four buttons for 4 seconds. When the light turns green, release the buttons. The device will flash green and red alternatively after which it will reconnect to the network.
- Method 2: Use a needle or paperclip to press the reset button on the back for 10 seconds. The behavior is similar to method 1

#### Device refuses actions

If actions (e.g.  applying zigbee2mqtt/bridge/config/remove to a dimmer) result in timeouts, perform a reset (see above) and apply the action right after the device announced itself in the network.

#### Device announces itself but the buttons don't work

The dimmer appears to be working normally and the logs in Zigbee2MQTT look good. However, nothing happens when a button is pressed (no light, no log message in Zigbee2MQTT). In this case:

- Reset the device
- Use zigbee2mqtt/bridge/config/remove to remove the device from the network (this should result in a "left the network" log message)
- Allow joining of new devices in Zigbee2MQTT
- Reset the device again
- Wait for it to pair again. The device should now be operational.

The information below only applies to the legacy integration.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It's worth setting \`debounce\` option with \`debounce_ignore: - action\` to throttle them without losing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)

{% raw %}
\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.5
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
\`\`\`
{% endraw %}

To find optimal "smoothness" play with debounce time or if you need all unique rotation steps consider adding \`brightness\` to \`debounce_ignore\` option

{% raw %}
\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.1
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
    - brightness

### Binding
The remote can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding) since firmware 2.3.014.
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time. Use the group name as \`TARGET_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME\`.
By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
This can be done by sending to \`zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/[DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME]]\` payload \`default_bind_group\`.

#### Note
This device with old firmware < 2.3.014 does not support binding (limitation of the device). A workaround is to first
get the group ID where the remote is sending it's commands to and add bulbs to the
same group ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/782#issuecomment-514526256)).

1. Pair the IKEA TRADFRI remote control to Zigbee2MQTT.
2. Enable debug logging (log_level: debug) ([documentation](../information/configuration.md)).
3. You will get log output like this: \`10/3/2019, 9:28:02 AM - debug: Received Zigbee message from '0x90fd9ffffe90d778'
of type 'commandToggle' with data '{}' from endpoint 1 with groupID 57173\`.
4. Retrieve the group from the log output, which is \`57173\` in the above example.
5. Add this group to \`configuration.yaml\` and add your device (e.g.) bulb to this group.
([documentation](../information/groups.md)).

### Binding
By default the switch is bound to the coordinator but this device can also be used to directly control other lights and switches in the network.

First unbind it from the coordinator, then you can bind it to any other device or group. (see https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/binding.html )

Now change the operation mode of the device, by default it is in \`event\` mode, but when binding we need to change it to \`command\` mode.
To do this send to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` payload \`{"operation_mode": "command"}\`, right before doing this make sure to wakeup the device.

As the device is sleeping by default, you need to wake it up after sending the bind/unbind command by pressing the reset button once.

When bound to a lamp, the behavior is as follows (for WXCJKG11LM Aqara Opple switch 1 band):
- left click: turn off
- right click: turn on
- left double click: light dim down (by steps of 33%)
- right double click: light dim up (by steps of 33%)

- long right click: cold white

If the device is asleep (which is most of the time) and you need it to be awake for some reason, tap the only button on the device. The LED will flash 5 times and the device will be awake for a brief period.

### Status of Functions
1. Temperature monitoring - Works
2. Humidity monitoring - Works
3. Battery monitoring - untested.
 * In theory the device LED will flash ONCE if the voltage falls below 2.4V
 * In theory the device will send a low-power report to the ZigBee network if the voltage falls below 2.4V - no other battery reporting.

This gives an audible alert with the LED flashing of around 2 seconds duration.

### Troubleshooting: device stops sending messages/disconnects from network
Since Xiaomi devices do not fully comply to the Zigbee standard, it sometimes happens that they disconnect from the network.
Most of the times this happens because of the following reasons:
- Device has a weak signal, you can see the signal quality in the published messages as \`linkquality\`. A linkquality < 20 is considered weak.
- Low battery voltage, this can even happen when the battery still appears full. Try a different battery.
- The device is connected through a router which cannot deal with Xiaomi devices. This is known to happen devices from: Centralite, General Electric, Iris, Ledvance, OSRAM, Sylvania, SmartThings, Securifi.

More detailed information about this can be found [here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/xiaomi-aqara-devices-pairing-keeping-them-connected/623).

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* \`no_occupancy_since\`: Timeout (in seconds) after \`no_occupancy_since\` is send.
This indicates the time since last occupancy was detected.
For example \`no_occupancy_since: [10, 60]\` will send a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 10}\` after 10 seconds
and a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 60}\` after 60 seconds.
* \`occupancy_timeout\`: Timeout (in seconds) after the \`occupancy: false\` message is sent.
If not set, the timeout is \`90\` seconds.
When set to \`0\` no \`occupancy: false\` is send.

**IMPORTANT**: \`occupancy_timeout\` should not be set to lower than 60 seconds.
The reason is this: after detecting a motion the sensor ignores any movements for
exactly 60 seconds. In case there are movements after this, a new message
(\`occupancy: true\`) will be sent and the sensor will go for one more minute sleep, and so on.
This is expected behaviour (see [#270](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/270#issuecomment-414999973)).
To work around this, a
[hardware modification](https://community.smartthings.com/t/making-xiaomi-motion-sensor-a-super-motion-sensor/139806)

delays in the network the release message is received late. This causes a single
click to be identified as a \`hold\` action. If you are experiencing this you can try
experimenting with this option (e.g. \`hold_timeout: 2000\`).
* \`hold_timeout_expire\`: Sometimes it happens that the button does not send a release. To avoid problems Zigbee2mqtt expires the \`hold\` leading to no \`release\` being send. The default timeout is 4000 ms, you can increase it with this option.

### Green Power
This is a Zigbee Green Power device which allows it to be very energy efficient.
Messages from Green Power devices cannot be "understood" by normal Zigbee devices, therefore they need to be "translated" first.
Not all Zigbee devices can do this translation, currently the only devices known to do this are Philips Hue devices. This means that the Green Power device has to be in range of a Philips Hue device in order to use it.

Green Power devices don't support binding and are not included in network scans.

### Pairing Philips Hue Tap
This device requires your Zigbee network to run on channel 11, 15, 20 or 25. In order to pair it hold the corresponding button for that channel 10 seconds.

| Button (dots) | Channel |
|-|-|
| 1 | 11 |
| 2 | 15 |
| 3 | 20 |
| 4 | 25 |

### Pairing Friends of Hue switches (EnOcean PTM 216Z module based)
This device has 4 buttons: A0 (left-top), A1 (left-bottom), B0 (right-top), B1 (right-bottom). In case the module is integrated in a single rocker switch, you need to remove the caps to expose all buttons. A button can be pressed by holding the contact of that button and then push the energy bar.

To pair it hold the corresponding button for that channel for 7 seconds or more.

| Button | Channel |
|-|-|
| A0 | 15 |
| A1 | 20 |
| B0 | 11 |
| B1 | 25 |

Once the device is paired you need to confirm the channel. To do this press A1 and B0 together. Important: don't press any other buttons between this and the pairing.

In case you want to pair it to a different channel you have to factory reset the device. This can be done by pressing all buttons (A0, A1, B0 and B1) simultaneously for at least 7 seconds.

This device can work on any channel, not only 15, 20, 11 or 25. For this refer to the [EnOcean PTM 216Z manual chapter 5.3](https://www.enocean.com/en/products/enocean_modules_24ghz/ptm-216z/user-manual-pdf/)

### Decoupled mode
Decoupled mode allows to turn wired switch into wireless button with separately controlled relay.
This might be useful to assign some custom actions to buttons and control relay remotely.
This command also allows to redefine which button controls which relay for the double switch (not supported for QBKG25LM).

Topic \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/system/set\` should be used to modify operation mode.

**NOTE:** For QBKG25LM instead of \`system\` use \`left\`, \`center\` or \`right\` and leave out the \`button\` property in the payload.

Payload:
\`\`\`js
{
  "operation_mode": {
    "button": "single"|"left"|"right", // Always use single for a single switch
    "state": "VALUE"

### Configuration of device attributes
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set\` various device attributes can be configured:
\`\`\`json
{
    "options":{
        "reverse_direction": xxx,
        "hand_open": xxx,
        "reset_limits": xxx
    }
}
\`\`\`

- **reverse_direction**: (\`true\`/\`false\`, default: \`false\`). Device can be configured to act in an opposite direction.
- **hand_open**: (\`true\`/\`false\`, default: \`true\`). By default motor starts rotating when you pull the curtain by hand. You can disable this behaviour.
- **reset_limits**: (\`true\`/\`false\`, default: \`false\`). Reset the motor. When a path was cleared from obstacles.

You can send a subset of options, all options that won't be specified will be revered to default.

After changing \`reverse_direction\` you will need to fully open and fully close the curtain so the motor will re-detect edges. \`reverse_direction\` will get new state only after this recalibration.

### Lost configuration on long power outage
If motor is used without battery it may lose configuration after long power outage. In that case you need to perform end stops calibration again publishing the following command sequence with topic \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set\`:
1. \`{ "options": { "reset_limits": true } }\`
2. \`{ "state": "close" }\`
3. Wait here for curtain closure.
4. \`{ "state": "open" }\`

Home Assistant automation example:
\`\`\`yaml
- alias: Calibrate curtain
  trigger:
  - platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set
      payload: "{ 'options': { 'reset_limits': true } }"
  - service: cover.close_cover
    entity_id: cover.<COVER_ID>
  - delay:
      seconds: 13 #wait for closure complete
  - service: cover.open_cover
    entity_id: cover.<COVER_ID>
\`\`\`

Motor leaves calibration mode automatically after it reaches the both open and close curtain position limits. Calibration is mandatory for proper position reporting and ability to set intermediate positions.

### Pairing
If you are having trouble pairing, reset the device.
- hold boost, +, and - (a count from 1 to 10 will be on the display, it may be required for the thermostat to de dismounted from the radiator valve for this to work)
- release once 'rES' is displayed
- hit boot once after 'Jin' is displayed to start pairing to the ZigBee network
- once successfully paired 'Ins' should be displayed and the boost button should flash green. Make sure the thermostat is mounted on the radiator valve before pressing the boost button again.
- now the display should read 'Ada' indicating the adapting process is started which should mechanically calibrate the thermostat to the valve.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It’s worth setting debounce option to throttle them without losing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)


\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_device
    debounce: 0.5
\`\`\`

### Controlling
*Current heating setpoint*
\`\`\`json
{
    "current_heating_setpoint": 21.5
}
\`\`\`
Current heating setpoint is also modified when occupied or unoccupied heating setpoint is set.

*System mode*

The system mode will be either \`off\`, \`auto\`, or \`heat\`. When set to \`heat\` the boost host flags will be set, when using \`off\` the window_open host flag will be set (and off will be displayed on the display).

*Eurotronic host flags*

The \`eurotronic_host_flags\` property contains an object with a true/false field for each host option.

\`\`\`json
{
  "eurotronic_host_flags": {
    "mirror_display": false,
    "boost": false,
    "window_open": false,
    "child_protection": true
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can toggle these flags by publishing a message to the \`set\` mqtt topic containing \`eurotronic_host_flags\`. e.g. enabling the display mirroring:
\`\`\`json
{"eurotronic_host_flags": {"mirror_display": true}}
\`\`\`

**Note that \`true\` or \`false\` do not have quotes aroud them!**

*Eurotronic system mode*

**This is deprecated in favor of eurotronic_host_flags, but will still work for now.**

This is a bitmap encoded field to set several device specific features. Please remind it is not possible to set single bits, always the full bitmap is written. Bit 0 doesnt seem to be writeable, it is always reported as set, so expect your written value + 1 to be reported.

Bit | Position
--- | --------
0 | unknown (default 1)
1 | Mirror display
2 | Boost
3 | unknown
4 | disable window open
5 | set window open (is reported as disable window open)
6 | unknown
7 | Child protection

Examples for eurotronic_system_mode:

Mirror display, reported as 3
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 2
}
\`\`\`
signal external window open, current_heating_setpoint will report "5", device display shows "OFF"
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 32
}
\`\`\`
signal external window close, will restore last current_heating_setpoint value
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 16
}
\`\`\`
Mirror display and set child protection.
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 66
}
\`\`\`

*Eurotronic error status*
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_error_status": 0
}
\`\`\`
This field is a readonly bitmap

Bit | Position
--- | --------
0 | reserved
1 | reserved
2 | reserved
3 | Valve adaption failed (E1)
4 | Valve movement too slow (E2)
5 | Valve not moving/blocked (E3)
6 | reserved
7 | reserved

    },
    {
        model: ['J1'],
        note: `
### Configuration of device attributes
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set\` various device attributes can be configured:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_j1": {
        "windowCoveringType": xxx,
        "configStatus": xxx,
        "installedOpenLimitLiftCm": xxx,
        "installedClosedLimitLiftCm": xxx,
        "installedOpenLimitTiltDdegree": xxx,
        "installedClosedLimitTiltDdegree": xxx,
        "turnaroundGuardTime": xxx,
        "liftToTiltTransitionSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps": xxx,
        "liftToTiltTransitionSteps2": xxx,
        "totalSteps2": xxx,
        "additionalSteps": xxx,
        "inactivePowerThreshold": xxx,
        "startupSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps2": xxx
    }
}
\`\`\`
For further details on these attributes please take a look at the
[ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5. Window Covering Cluster (Server)".

As an alternative to the attributes listed above, the following properties may be used for convenience:
* \`open_to_closed_s\`: corresponds to \`totalSteps\`, but takes value in seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`closed_to_open_s\`: ditto for \`totalSteps2\`,
* \`lift_to_tilt_transition_ms\`: sets both \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps\` and \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps2\`
(they shall both be equal according to ubisys manual), but takes value in *milli*seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`steps_per_second\`: factor to be used for conversion, defaults to 50 full AC waves per second if not provided

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get/configure_j1\` the values of the configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log.

### Calibration
By publishing \`{"configure_j1": {"calibrate": 1}}\` to \`zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set\` the device can also be
calibrated after installation to support more advanced positioning features
(i.e. go to lift percentage / go to tilt percentage). This can be combined with setting attributes as shown above,
for example:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_j1": {
        "calibrate" : 1,
        "windowCoveringType": 8,
        "lift_to_tilt_transition_ms": 1600
    }
}
\`\`\`
The calibration procedure will move the shutter up and down several times and the current stage of the
calibration process will again be logged to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log for the user to get some feedback.
For details on the calibration procedure please again take a look at
the [ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5.1. Calibration".
Please note that tilt transition steps cannot be determined automatically and must therefore be
configured manually for the device to also support "go to tilt percentage". One possibility to determine the
correct value is to take a video of the blinds moving from 0 to 100 percent tilt and then getting the exact timing
from the video by playing it slow motion.

### Home Assistant cover features when using [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant)
The cover will be offered to Home Assistant as supporting lift and tilt by default, but for covers with reduced
functionality this can be passed along to Home Assistant by disabling some of the topics in \`configuration.yaml\`,
for example:
\`\`\`yaml
'0x001fee0000001234':
    friendly_name: cover_not_supporting_tilt'
    homeassistant:
    tilt_command_topic: null
    tilt_status_topic: null
'0x001fee0000001234':
    friendly_name: cover_supporting_neither_lift_nor_tilt'
    homeassistant:

    position_topic: null
    tilt_command_topic: null
    tilt_status_topic: null

### Pairing
Factory reset the Lutron Connected Bulb Remote by pressing and holding the remote's top and bottom buttons for approximately 15 seconds. The light on the remote will blink rapidly to indicate that the remote has been reset.

After resetting the remote can be paired to a network by pressing and holding the top button for approximately 2 seconds.

#### Using the Connected Bulb Remote to reset a connected light bulb (Hue, Cree, GE Link)
Connected light bulbs can be reset with the Lutron Connected Bulb Remote by bringing the remote close (~3 inches) to the light bulb and pressing and holding the remote's 2nd and bottom buttons. The light bulb will flash and the remote's LED will turn on. Continue to hold both buttons until the remote's LED turns off.

After resetting the bulb will automatically attempt to join a network.

This method should work for Philips Hue bulbs, IKEA TRADFRI bulbs, GE Link bulbs, Connected Cree bulbs, and EcoSmart SMART bulbs.

### Pairing

Press the side button of the device with a paper clip for more than 2 seconds. The main button led will flash. Then make sure the device is awake during pairing phase or the configuration may fail. To ensure device is awake press the main button every 2 seconds until configuration is done in Zigbee2MQTT logs.

### Important
There are 3 versions of this device: Standalone, Zigbee and Z-wave. These are visualy identical. Make sure to get the correct version that will work with Zigbee2MQTT:

Supported:
- **HS1SA-M : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-N : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-E : Zigbee 3.0**

Unsupported:
- HS1SA : Standalone
- HS1SA-Z : Z-wave

The product code should end in *-M* for the Zigbee version. The label inside the battery compartment should also show the Zigbee logo.

        note: `
### Device pairing/installation
To put the TRV in installation mode twist and hold the cap in the  **+** direction
until the central LED flashes green.  The device is ready for joining when:

- left/right LEDs flash red/blue
- central LED shows a solid orange

If central light shows a solid green, your TRV has been paired and is connected to the zigbee network.

If blinking with yellow, then your TRV is not paired or can't connect to the zigbee network. If Zigbee2MQTT is running and accepting new devices the valve should join the network. Sometimes you may need to twist and hold the cap in the **+** direction for 3 seconds before it will try to join.

**Note:** Zigbee2MQTT might not be able to correctly configure the TRV until you have [calibrated](#calibrate) it.

If the valve is not recognized, you can turn the boost button to positive and hold it; the red light starts to blink slowly. Release the button once the red light stops blinking.

### Calibrate
After installing the TRV twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold for
2 seconds until the blue LED lights up.

### Device hard reset
If the device fails to pair/join the network (\`red:yellow:blue\` on paring mode) or you changed the network id/channel, connect to another network, bought the TRV second hand, you can perform a factory reset to start fresh.

1. Make sure that the TRV is NOT in pairing mode.
2. Twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold till blue light turns off and then center light blinks red (about 15 seconds).
3. Release the button, you should see a \`red:gree:blue\` short flash; the valve will go into installation mode.

### Controlling

Valve sometimes fails to respond/acknowledge a setting, just send the command again.

- Get local temperature in degrees Celsius.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "local_temperature": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get or set occupied heating setpoint to *&lt;temperature&gt;* in degrees Celsius. Possible values: 7 to 30 by default; leave empty to read.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "occupied_heating_setpoint": "<temperature>"
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get or set the keypad lock, i.e. enable/disable twist-top boost. Possible values: "unlock", "lock1". **WARNING** Setting the keypad to lock (i.e. "lock1") disables the twist-top boost button which impedes setting the valve to installation mode or hard-reseting it.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "keypad_lockout": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the battery level, in percentage. Possible values 0 to 100 (%). The level corresponds voltages in the range 2.2 V (0%) to 3.0 V (100%). The levels where chosen so a 0% indicates that batteries must be replaced, but the valve will still work.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "battery": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the battery voltage. Possible values 0.0 to 3.0 (V). This is a direct measure of the battery voltage.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "voltage": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the (latest) twist-top boost state. Possible values:

    | Attribute Value | Description |
    | -----------------|----------------------------------------------- |
    | 1 | Boost up |
    | 0 | No boost |
    | -1 | Boost down |

    Note that the valve will not automatically toggle the value to 0 after some time, i.e. configuration/automation logic is needed to use the value. E.g. in Home Assistant the \`expire_after\` setting can be used to handle this.

- Get the valve position / heating demand. Will report the valve position or heating amount depending. Possible values 0 to 100 (%).
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "pi_heating_demand": ""
    }
    \`\`\`
- Get the valve motor state. Possible values: "Stall", others. String description of the motor state. Seems to change when the motor is moving.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "MOT": ""
    }
    \`\`\`
- Get the Zigbee link quality. Possible values 0 to 100 (%).
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "linkquality": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
\`\`\`
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
\`\`\`

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

\`\`\` yaml
- id: auto_publish_outdoor_temp
  description: publish the outdoor temperature to Stelpro thermostat
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.outdoor_sensor_temperature
      condition: []
  action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data_template:
      payload: '{{ states(trigger.entity_id) }}'
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/THERMOSTAT_FRIENDLY_NAME/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature'
\`\`\`

**IMPORTANT**: The outdoor temperature need to be refreshed at least each 4 hours, or the \`EXT\` display will be cleared on the thermostat.
